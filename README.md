Cubi-Ng
=======

Cubi-Ng provides a practical framework of creating Single Page Application (SPA) based on angularjs.

Some history
------------

Cubi-Ng is a combination of Cubi and Angularjs. Also you may call it NextGeneration Cubi. 

Cubi was initially an open source application platform https://code.google.com/p/openbiz-cubi/. It was written on top of openbiz library which is a framework with metadata driven development architecture (MDDA). Cubi provides a set of common components and tools for building a complicated web application. Developing web app on Cubi is easy and efficient.

Angularjs https://angularjs.org/ a fantastic javascript library featured with two-way data binding. It is widely used since 2013 to create modern single page applications. It gets more popular comparing with other javascript frameworks. See trend at http://www.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US#q=Angularjs,+Backbone.js,+Ember.js&date=today+12-m&cmpt=q

Current Web Technology Trend
============================
As the following chart demonstrated, web architecture has evolved through 3 stages:
- Model 1: classic web application
- Model 2: AJAX web application
- Model 3: Client side MV web application

Cubi is a mature web platform based on Model 2 (AJAX web application), Cubi-Ng is the Model 3 new generation. Its goal is to make single page application development easier.

With Model 3, SPA is a typical UI theme.

Single Page Application
-----------------------
What is SPA? A single-page application (SPA), also known as single-page interface (SPI), is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application. This definition is copied from Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application.

Single page applications (SPA) are more capable of decreasing load time of pages by storing the functionality once it is loaded the first time, allowing easier data transfer between pages and a more complex user interface instead of trying to control so much from the server. This allows for more interference from an end user.
